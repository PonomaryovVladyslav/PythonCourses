                              Classes and Objects
*******************************************************************************

Conceptually, objects are like the components of a system. Think of a program
as a factory assembly line of sorts. At each step of the assembly line a system
component processes some material, ultimately transforming raw material into a
finished product.

An object contains data, like the raw or preprocessed materials at each step on
an assembly line, and behavior, like the action each assembly line component
performs.

Paradigm of Object-Oriented Programming
=======================================

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of
structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled together
into individual **objects**.

For instance, an object could represent a person with **properties** like
a name, age, and address and **behaviors** such as walking, talking, running.
Or it could represent an email with properties like a recipient list, subject,
and body and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.

Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling
concrete, real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things,
like companies and employees, students and teachers, and so on. OOP models
real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with
them and can perform certain functions.


Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
====================================

So far, we can discuss the major concepts within the OOP paradigm.
And they are:

:**encapsulation**:

    In OOP refers to the bundling of data with methods that operate that data,
    or restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.

    .. note:: Encapsulation mechanism is often confused with *hiding*. It's not
              actually that encapsulation does, but data hiding is available to
              us due to the encapsulation.

:**inheritance**:

    It's a mechanism of basing an object or a class upon another object
    (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance),
    retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes
    (subclasses) from existing ones such as a super class or base class and
    forming them into a hierarchy of classes.

:**polymorphism**:

    It's a provision of a single interface to entities of different types or
    the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types.
    The concept is borrowed from a principle in biology where an organism or
    species can have many different forms or stages.

:**abstraction**:

    The process of removing or generalizing details or attributes in the study
    of objects or systems to focus attention on details of greater importance,
    it is similar in nature to the process of generalization.
    The creation of abstract concept-objects by mirroring common features or
    attributes of various non-abstract objects or systems of study is the
    result of the process of abstraction.

Define a Class in Python
========================

Primitive data-structures - like numbers, strings, lists etc. - are designed to
represent simple pieces of information, such as the cost of a product, the name
of a novel, or someone's favorite colors. What if you want to represent things
that are more complex?

For example, let's say you want to track employees in an organization. You need
to store some basic information about each employee. Let's start from a very
beginning and try to represent an individual employee as a bunch of variables:

.. code-block:: python

    first_name = "Serhii"
    last_name = "Horodilov"
    job_title = "Software Engineer"

This approach has number of issues. Once it's required to store information
for more that one person, you are to create another set of variables:
``first_name_1``, ``first_name_2`` etc. The most terrifying issue is that these
portions of data have no relations to each other. Let's try to use ``list`` for
this purpose:

.. code-block:: python

    serhii = ["Serhii", "Horodilov", "Software Engineer"]
    vlad = ["Vladyslav", "Ponomaryov", "Release Manager"]

There are number of issues with this approach as well.

First, it can make larger code files more difficult to manage. If you reference
``serhii[0]`` several lines away from where ``serhii`` list is declared, will
you remember that the element with ``index 0`` is the person's name? Of course,
you can use ``dict`` structure, but...

Second, it can introduce errors if not every person has the same number of
properties.

A great way to make this type of code more manageable and more maintainable is
to use **classes**.

All classes definitions in Python start with the keyword ``class``, which is
followed by the name of the class and a colon. Any code that is indented below
the class definition is considered the part of the class's body.

.. code-block:: python

    class Person:
        """Person class implementation"""

Classes vs Instances
====================

Classes are used to create user-defined data structures. As it was mentioned
above OOP is about bundling data and behaviors. Classes define data structures;
each portion of data bundled within a classes is called **property** or
**field**. Classes also define functions called **methods**, which identify the
behavior and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its
data.

.. code-block:: python

    class Person:
        """Person class implementation"""

        first_name: str = ""
        last_name: str = ""
        job_title: str = ""

A class is a blueprint for how something should be defined. It doesn't actually
contain any data. The person class above specifies that ``first_name`` and
``last_name`` properties are bundled within this class, but it don't actually
contain the person's name.

While classes are blueprints, an **instance** is an **object** that is built
from a form has been filled out with information. Just like many people can
fill out the same form with their own unique information, many instances can
be created from a single class.

.. code-block:: python

    serhii = Person()
    serhii.first_name = "Serhii"
    serhii.last_name = "Horodilov"
    serhii.job_title = "Software Engineer"

    vlad = Person()
    vlad.first_name = "Vladyslav"
    vlad.last_name = "Ponomaryov"
    vlad.job_title = "Release Manager"

Methods
=======

A function bundled within a class is called **method**. There are several ways
to define a class method. For now it's needed to know, that each method will
get a special argument at the first position. This argument is a reference to
an actual object. By convention, this argument is called ``self``.

.. code-block:: python

    class Person:
        """Person class implementation"""

        first_name: str = ""
        last_name: str = ""
        job_title: str = ""

        def get_fullname(self) -> str:
            """Return a person's fullname"""

            return " ".join([self.first_name, self.last_name])

Initializing Instance with Data
-------------------------------

There are several methods surrounded with double underscores (``__method__``)
that are called **dunder methods** or **magic methods**. We'll take a closer
look at these methods in the future. For now, it's ok to just one of these
special methods: ``__init__``. It initializes an instance with some specific
data.

.. code-block:: python

    class Person:
        """Person class implementation"""

        programming_language: str = "Python"

        def __init__(
            self, first_name: str, last_name: str, job_title: str
        ) -> None:
            """Initialize a person instance"""

            self.first_name = first_name
            self.last_name = last_name
            self.job_title = job_title

        def get_fullname(self) -> str:
            """Return a person's fullname"""

            return " ".join([self.first_name, self.last_name])


    serhii = Person("Serhii", "Horodilov", "Software Engineer")
    vlad = Person("Vladyslav", "Ponomaryov", "Release Manager")

    serhii.first_name  # Serhii
    serhii.last_name   # Horodilov

Note, this call definition has a property called ``programming_language``
defined outside of the ``__init__`` method. This property is shared across
all the class instances.

Some More Details on ``self``
-----------------------------

``self`` is nothing except the convention. Instance methods will receive
a pointer to the instance itself as the first argument. In two words: it is
the actual object to call the method with. For example, the student class
defines attributes (student's name and scores) and methods available for
each student instance: complete the challenge or skip classes. While the
actual student instance contains data and methods related to the exact one
student. The ``self`` is a referer to this exact object.

Data Hiding
===========

Many programming languages has *access modifiers* implemented. The Python has
also.

.. image:: /../assets/img/wy_ban.jpg
    :align: center

"Private" instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an
object don't exist in Python :cite:`docs-python:private-variables`. It's
implemented as a convention-level.

A name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. ``_spam``) should be treated as
a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data
member). These should not be used outside the class itself and can be changed
without notice.

Since there is a valid use case for class-private members (namely to avoid name
clashes of names with names defined by subclasses), there is limited support
for such a mechanism, called *name mangling*. Any identifier with at least two
leading underscore (e.g. ``__spam``) is textually replaced with
``_classname__spam``, where ``_classname`` is the current class name with
leading underscore stripped.

.. code-block:: python

    class Employee:
        """Employee superclass example"""

        first_name: str = ""
        last_name: str = ""

        _rate: int = 0
        __tax: float = 0.18

        def _get_amount(self, hours: int) -> int:
            return self._rate * hours

        def _get_tax(self, amount: int) -> int:
            return int(round(self.__tax * amount, 0))

        def get_balance(self, hours: int) -> int:
            amount = self._get_amount(hours)
            tax = self._get_tax(amount)

            return amount - tax

        def set_rate(self, rate: int) -> None:
            self._rate = rate


    class Employee10PercentTax(Employee):
        _Employee__tax = 0.10


Few Words about Inheritance
===========================

.. note:: Just in two words. This topic is discovered in the future articles.

You can derive your classes from a super class. Derived classes are called
*sub classes* and the class used to inherit from is called *super class*.
Other terms are *child* class and *parent* class, but they are not common
(this is author's personal opinion).

Just put a super class in parenthesis two inherit from it:

.. code-block:: python

    class Dog():
        """Abstract dog implementation"""


    class JackRussellTerrier(Dog):
        """Jack russell terrier species implementation"""

Few Words about Polymorphism
============================

You've already use this. The most simple explanation is **addition operator**.
For different types of data it would produce different types of output:

.. code-block:: python

    ["a", "b", "c"] + ["d"]  # the result is ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    "a" + "b" + "cd"         # the result is "abcd"

For example you may have various classes inherited from a base class, that
provides a common interface, but each derived class may implement the method
in its own way.

.. code-block:: python

    class Animal:
        """Abstract animal"""

        def voice(self):
            pass


    class Cat(Animal):
        def voice(self):
            print("MEOW")


    class Dog(Animal):
        def voice(self):
            print("ARF)
