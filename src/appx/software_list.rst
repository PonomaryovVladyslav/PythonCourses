cygwin
------

It is a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide
functionality similar to a `Linux
distribution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution>`__ on
Windows and a DLL (cygwin1.dll) which provides substantial POSIX API
functionality.

**Cygwin is not**:

-  a way to run native Linux apps on Windows. You must rebuild your
   application *from source* if you want it to run on Windows.
-  a way to magically make native Windows apps aware of UNIX®
   functionality like ``signals``, ``ptys`` etc. Again, you need to
   build your apps *from source* if you want to take advantage of Cygwin
   functionality.

source <https://git-scm.com/about/free-and-open-source>`__ distributed
