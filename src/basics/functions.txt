*******************************************************************************

You may be familiar with the mathematical concept of a **function**. It is
a relationship or mapping between one or more inputs and a set of outputs.

.. math::

    z = f(x, y)

Here ``f`` is a function that operates on the inputs ``x`` and ``y``, and
its output is bind to ``z``.

In programming a **function** is a self-contained block of code that
encapsulate a specific task or related group of tasks.

You may be familiar with some built-in functions like ``max``, ``min``, ``len``
etc.

The usual syntax for defining a Python function is as follows:

::

    def <function_name>([<parameters>]):
        <statement>

+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Component           | Meaning                                               |
+=====================+=======================================================+
| ``def``             | The keyword that informs Python that a function is    |
|                     | being defined                                         |
+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| ``<function_name>`` | A valid Python identifier that names the function     |
+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| ``<parameters>``    | An optional, comma-separated list of parameters that  |
|                     | may be passed to the function                         |
+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| ``<statement(s)>``  | A block of valid Python statements;                   |
|                     | **body** of the function                              |
+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

The syntax for calling a Python function is as follows:

::

    <function_name>([<arguments>])

The ``<arguments>`` are the values passed into the function. They correspond
to the ``<parameters>`` in the function definition. You can define a function
that doesn't take any arguments, but the parentheses are still required. Both
a function definition and a function call must always include parentheses,
even if they're empty.

Argument passing
================

More often, you want to **pass data into a function**.

Positional arguments
--------------------

.. note::

    Because of the way they're defined and used, positional arguments are also
    called *required arguments*.

The most straightforward way to pass arguments to a function is with
**positional arguments**.
In the function definition, you specify a comma-separated list of parameters
inside the parentheses.
When the function is called, you specify a corresponding list of arguments.

The parameters behave like **variables** that are defined locally to the
function.

Although positional arguments are the most straightforward way to pass data to
a function, they also afford the least flexibility. For starters, the **order**
of the arguments in the call must match the order of the parameters in the
definition.

There's nothing to stop you from specifying positional arguments out of order.
The function even may still run, but it's very unlikely to produce the correct
results.

.. note::

    It's responsibility of the programmer who defines the function to document
    what the appropriate arguments should be, and it's the responsibility of
    the user of the function to be aware of that information and abide by it.

With positional arguments, the arguments in the call and the parameters in the
definition must agree not only in order, but in number as well.

Keyword arguments
-----------------

When calling a function, you can specify arguments in the form
``<keyword>=<value>``. In that case, each ``<keyword>`` must match a parameter
in the function definition. Referencing a keyword that doesn't match any of
these declared parameters generates an exception.

Using keyword arguments lifts the restriction on arguments order. Each keyword
argument explicitly designates a specific parameter by name, so you can specify
them in any order and Python will still know which argument goes with which
parameter.

Like with positional arguments, though, the number of arguments and parameters
must still match.

You can call a function using both positional and keyword arguments.
Once you've specified a keyword argument, there can't be any positional
arguments to the right of it.

Default values
--------------

If a parameter specified in the function definition has the form of
``<name>==<value>``, then ``<value>`` becomes a default value for that
parameter. Parameters defined this way are referred to as
**default or optional parameters**.

.. rubric:: Mutable default parameter values

Things can get weird if you specify a default parameter value that is
a mutable object.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> def add_to_container(item, container = []):
    ...     container.append(item)
    ...
    >>>
    >>> add_to_container(42, [1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3, 42]
    >>> add_to_container("foobar", ["foo", "bar"])
    ["foo", "bar", "foobar"]
    >>> add_to_container(42)
    [42]
    >>> add_to_container("foobar")  # ["foobar"]
    [42, "foobar"]

In Python default parameter values are **defined only once** when the function
is defined. The default value isn't re-defined each time the function is
called. For the example above, each time the ``add_to_container`` function is
called without passing ``container`` argument, the ``.append`` statement is
performed on the same list.

Mutable and immutable arguments
-------------------------------

.. note::

    Roughly, you may consider immutable object as passed-by-value,
    and mutable objects as passed-by-reference.
    However, that's not actual true.

In programming language design, there are two common paradigms for passing an
argument to a function:

-   **pass-by-value** means a copy of the argument is passed to the function.
-   **pass-by-reference** means a reference to the argument is passed to
    the function.

Are parameters in Python pass-by-value or pass-by-reference? They're neither,
exactly. That's because a reference doesn't mean quite the same thing in
Python as it does in C-like languages.

Recall that in Python, every piece of data is an **object**. A reference points
to an object, not a specific memory location.

Take a look on the code below:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    value = 24
    value = 42

These assignment statements have the following meaning:

-   **Line 1** cause ``value`` to point to an object whose value is ``24``.
-   **Line 2** reassign ``value`` as a new reference to a different object
    whose value is ``42``.

In Python, when you pass an argument to a function, a similar *rebinding*
occurs.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def reassign(fx: int) -> None:
        fx = 10


    x = 5
    reassign(x)

In the main program, the statement ``x = 5`` on line 5 creates a reference
named ``x`` bound to an object whose value is ``5``.
``reassign`` is then called on line 6 with ``x`` as its argument.
When a function first starts, a new reference called ``fx`` is created, which
initially points to the same ``5`` object. However, when the statement
``fx = 10`` on line 2 is executed, ``reassign`` rebinds ``fx`` to a new
object whose value is ``10``. From now, the two references ``x`` and ``fx`` are
uncoupled one from another. Nothing else that function does will affect ``x``,
and when function terminates, ``x`` will still point to the object ``5``, as it
did prior to the function call.

You can confirm all this using ``id()``. Here's a slightly augmented version of
the code above:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def reassign(fx: int) -> None:
        print(f"{fx = }, {id(fx) = }")
        fx = 10
        print(f"{fx = }, {id(fx) = }")


    x = 5
    print(f"{x = }, {id(x) = }")
    reassign(x)
    print(f"{x = }, {id(x) = }")

The outputs will look like:

::

    x = 5, id(x) = 140706772804520
    fx = 5, id(fx) = 140706772804520
    fx = 42, id(fx) = 140706772805704
    x = 5, id(x) = 140706772804520

.. note::

    Python's argument-passing mechanism has been called **pass-by-assignment**.
    You may also see terms pass-by-object, pass-by-object-reference, or
    pass-by-sharing. This is because parameter names are bound to objects on
    function entry in Python, and assignment is also the process of binding
    a name to an object.

The key takeaway here is that Python function can't change the value of an
argument by reassigning the corresponding parameter to something else.

However, functions can use references to make modifications inside of a mutable
objects.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    >>> def insert_into_container(item, container, idx = 0):
    ...    container.insert(idx, item)
    ...
    >>>
    >>> numbers = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> insert_into_container(42, numbers)
    >>> numbers
    [42, 1, 2, 3]

The return statement
====================

It serves two purposes:

-   It immediately terminates the function and passes execution control back
    to the caller.
-   It provides a mechanism by which the function can pass data back
    to the caller.

The return statement can be used inside of a function or a method to send
the result back to the caller. It consists of the ``return`` Python keyword
and an optional return value.

The return value of a Python function can be any Python object (and you should
remember - everything in Python is an object).

You can omit the return value and use bare ``return`` without a return value.
You can also omit the entire ``return`` statement. In both cases, the return
value will be ``None``. So, Python functions always have the return value; in
case it hasn't been specified - it's ``None``.

.. important:: **Returning vs Printing**

    If you're working in an interactive session, then you might think that
    printing a value and returning a value are equivalent.
    Consider the following two functions:

    .. code-block:: python

        from typing import List


        def print_evens(numbers: List[int]) -> None:
            print([number for number in numbers if not number % 2])


        def return_evens(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
            return [number for number in numbers if not number % 2]

    And their output:

    ::

        >>> print_evens([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
        [2, 4, 6, 8]
        >>> return_evens([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
        [2, 4, 6, 8]

    Both functions seems to do the same thing. But only the second one
    function actually returns a value, when the first one returns nothing
    (or **NoneType object**).

Return multiple values
----------------------

You can use a return statement to return multiple values from a function.
To do that, you just need to supply several return values separated by commas.
The function will return a tuple of values.

.. code-block:: python

    import statistics as st


    def describe(data):
        return st.mean(data), st.median(data), st.mode(data)


    sample = [8, 1, 9, 1, 4, 6, 1, 9, 8, 3]
    mean, median, mode = describe(sample)

The built-in ``divmod`` function is also an example of a function that returns
multiple values. The function takes two (non-complex) numbers as arguments and
returns two numbers, the quotient of the two input values and the remainder of
the division.

Variable-length argument list
=============================

In some cases, when you're defining a function, you may not know beforehand how
many arguments you'll want it to take.

For example, a function that computes an average of several values may look
something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    def avg(a, b, c):
        return (a + b + c) / 3

However, as you're already seen, when positional arguments are used, the number
of arguments passed must match the number of parameters declared.

Argument tuple packing
----------------------

When a parameter name in a function definition is preceded by an asterisk (\*),
it indicates **argument tuple packing**. Any corresponding arguments in
a function call are packed into a tuple that the function can refer to by
the given parameter name.

.. code-block:: python

    def avg(*args):
        return sum(args) / len(args)

Any name can be used, but *args* is so commonly chosen that it's practically
a standard.

Argument tuple unpacking
------------------------

An analogous operation is available on the other side of the equation in
a function call. When an argument in a function call is preceded by an asterisk,
it indicates that the argument is a tuple that should be **unpacked** and
passed to the function as separate values.

.. code-block:: python

    def demo_args_unpacking(a, b, c):
        print(f"{a = }, {b = }, {c = }")


    args = 10, 20, 30
    demo_args_unpacking(*args)

.. note::

    Although this type of unpacking is called **tuple** unpacking, it doesn't
    only work with tuples. The asterisk can be applied to any iterable in
    a function call.

    .. code-block:: python

        arguments_list = [10, 20, 30]
        demo_args_unpacking(*arguments_list)
        arguments_set = {10, 20, 30}
        demo_args_unpacking(*arguments_set)
        arguments_str = "ABC"
        demo_args_unpacking(*arguments_str)

.. note::

    You can even do tuple packing and unpacking at the same time.

    .. code-block:: python

        def avg(*args) -> float:
            return sum(args) / len(args)


        numbers = 10, 20, 30
        average = avg(*numbers)

Argument dictionary packing
---------------------------

Python has a similar operator, the double asterisk (\*\*), which can be used
with function parameters to specify **dictionary packing**. Preceding parameter
in a function definition be a double asterisk indicates that the corresponding
arguments, which are expected to be keyword arguments (``key=value`` pairs),
should be packed into a dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    def display_person(first_name: str, last_name: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        print(f"{first_name.title()} {last_name.title()}")
        for key, value in kwargs.items():
            print(f"{key}:\t{value}")


    display_person("serhii", "horodilov", school="A-Level", course="Python")

Again, any name can be used, but the peculiar *kwargs* (which is short for
*keyword args*) is nearly standard.

Argument dictionary unpacking
-----------------------------

This is analogous to argument tuple unpacking.
When the double asterisk precedes an argument in a function call, it specifies
that the argument is a dictionary that should be unpacked, with the resulting
items passed to the function as keyword arguments.

.. code-block:: python

    person_data = {
        "first_name": "Serhii",
        "last_name": "Horodilov",
        "school": "A-Level",
        "course": "Python",
        "school_occupation": "teacher/mentor",
        "job_title": "Software Engineer",
    }
    display_person(**person_data)

Lambda functions
================

Lambda expressions in Python and other programming languages have their roots
in lambda calculus, a model of computation invented by Alonzo Church.
Python is not inherently a functional language, but it adopted some functional
concepts early on. In January 1994, ``map()``, ``filter()``, ``reduce()``, and
the lambda operator were added to the language.

General lambda function syntax is:

::

    lambda [<parameters>]: <expression>

+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Component           | Meaning                                               |
+=====================+=======================================================+
| ``lambda``          | The keyword that informs Python that a function is    |
|                     | being defined                                         |
+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| ``<parameters>``    | An optional, comma-separated list of parameters that  |
|                     | may be passed to the function                         |
+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| ``<expression>``    | A valid Python expression; return statement           |
+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

.. code-block:: python

    def get_fullname(first_name: str, last_name: str):
        return f"{first_name.title()} {last_name.title()}"


    lambda first_name, last_name: f"{first_name.title()} {last_name.title()}"

The code sample above demonstrates the ``get_fullname`` Python function and its
lambda version. A lambda form presents syntactic distinctions from a normal
function. In particular, a lambda function has the following characteristics:

-   It can only contain expressions and can’t include statements in its body.
-   It is written as a single line of execution.
-   It does not support type annotations.
-   It can be immediately invoked
    (:abbr:`IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Execution)`).

    .. code-block:: python

        (lambda number: "odd" if number % 2 else "even")(42)

.. rubric:: Classic functional constructs

.. code-block:: python

    >>> # in-place data modifications
    >>> list(map(lambda x: x.upper(), ["foo", "bar", "foobar"]))
    ["FOO", "BAR", "FOOBAR"]
    >>> # filtering values
    >>> list(filter(lambda x: not x % 2, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]))
    [2, 4, 6]
    >>> # reduce values
    >>> from functools import reduce
    >>> reduce(lambda acc, x: acc ^ x, [1, 2, 3, 1234, 3, 2, 1])
    1234
