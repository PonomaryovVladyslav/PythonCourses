.. todo: split into "if" statement and loop documents

``if`` statement
================

Perhaps the most well-known statement type is ``if`` statement. For example:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: if statement base example

    >>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
    >>> if x < 0:
    ...     x = 0
    ...     print("Negative x changed to 0")
    ... elif x == 0:
    ...     print("x is equal to zero")
    ... elif x == 1:
    ...     print("x is equal to one")
    ... else:
    ...     print("x is greater than one")

But let's dive into ``if`` statement with more simple examples.

How it works
------------

**if** statement is defined with a keyword ``if`` followed by a Boolean
expression or any object and finished with colon. The statement requires
a *body*: other statements to execute, also called an *if block*.
The body is indented at the same distance from the left (in Python we use
4 spaces to indent a single block of code).

The body's statements will be executed only in case **if** expression is
``True``.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from random import randint

    number: int = randint(1, 2)

    if not number % 2:  # the as number % 2 == 0
        print(number, "is even")

The ``print`` statement on line #6 will be executed only for even value of
``number`` variable.

``else`` block
--------------

``if`` can be used by its own, it can extend its behavior with ``else`` block.
The general syntax for ``else`` body is the same: at least one indented
statement. But ``else`` doesn't take any expression after it. This block of
code will be executed only that the ``if`` statement truth check fails.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from random import randint

    number: int = randint(1, 2)

    if not number % 2:
        print(number, "is even")
    else:
        print(number, "is odd")

You can attach **only one** else block to **if statement**. And you cannot use
``else`` statement on its own - this will cause *SyntaxError*.

``elif`` block(s)
-----------------

``elif`` (*else if*) statement may be considered as semi-statement between
``if`` and ``else`` statements. In case your program has more than two
dedicated choices you are able to extends control flow by appending
``elif`` blocks after ``if`` statement. The syntax is pretty similar to ``if``
statement. Each ``elif`` has its own boolean expression or an object to test
for the truth value.

You can attach as many ``elif`` statements as it needed. But you cannot use
``elif`` without ``if`` statement.

Python will test conditions in ``if`` and ``elif`` statements from top to
bottom. The first one, which considered to be ``True`` will be executed.
All others will be skipped.

If there were no truth conditions ``else`` block will be executed (if exists).

.. code-block:: python

    >>> x = int(input("Enter some integer number: "))
    >>> if not x % 5 and not x % 3: # the same as x % 5 == 0 and x % 3 == 0
    ...     print(x, "is divisible by 5 and 3")
    ... elif not x % 5:
    ...     print(x, "is divisible by 5")
    ... elif not x % 3:
    ...     print(x, "is divisible by 3")
    ... else:
    ...     print(x, "is not divisible by 5 or 3")

.. note::

    The order conditions appears matter.
    The truth test goes from top to bottom and stops at first expression
    which is ``True``.

Usage
-----

``if/elif/else`` statements help you to control which portion of your code is
executed based on conditions from outer scope.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Ask user for input
    grade = int(input("Enter your grade (0-100): "))

    # Use if/elif/else statements to assign letter grade
    if grade >= 90:
        letter_grade = "A"
    elif grade >= 80:
        letter_grade = "B"
    elif grade >= 70:
        letter_grade = "C"
    elif grade >= 60:
        letter_grade = "D"
    else:
        letter_grade = "F"

    # Print the letter grade
    print("Your letter grade is:", letter_grade)
