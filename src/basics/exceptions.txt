*******************************************************************************
                             Errors and Exceptions
*******************************************************************************

There are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors:
*syntax errors* and *exceptions* :cite:`docs-python:errors`.

Syntax errors
=============

Syntax errors are also known as parsing errors.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> while True print("the loop is running...")
      File "<string>", line 1
        while True print('the loop is running...')
                   ^^^^^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax

The parser repeats the offending line and displays a little "arrow" pointing at
the earliest point in the line where the error was detected. The error is
caused by (or at least detected at) the token preceding the arrow.

Exceptions
==========

Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an
error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during execution
are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal: you will soon learn
how to handle them in Python programs.

Exceptions come in different types, and the type is printed as part of
the message.

For example, the ``div`` function implemented as

.. code-block:: python

    def div(x: Union[int, float], y: Union[int, float]) -> float:
        """Return the result of dividing `x` by `y`."""

        return x / y

may cause a ``ZeroDivisionError`` exception in case 0 is passed as ``y``
parameter.

Standard exception names are built-in identifiers (not reserved keywords).

.. seealso:: The list of `built-in exceptions`_

Tracebacks
==========

.. note:: "File" is replaced with a *dummy string* within the examples.

Let's assume the following modules structure:

::

    /
    |-- main.py
    |-- func.py

The **main** module imports a ``div`` function implemented above from the
**func** module. The code in main is implemented as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from func import div

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
        y = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
        print(f"{x = }, {y = } -> {div(x, y) = }")

While running the code with correct inputs it will work fine. But there are
at two exceptions for this script.

The first one is related on type conversion. While running the main script
there is case of invalid input.

::

    Please enter a number: 100
    Please enter a number: one
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "path/to/module.py", line 5, in <module>
        y = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
    ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'one'

Note the **traceback** indicates the module and the exact line of code that
causes the exception.

The second one exception occurs when a 0 is passed as the second parameter to
``div`` function. The traceback would look like:

::

    Please enter a number: 100
    Please enter a number: 0
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "path/to/main.py", line 6, in <module>
        print(f"{x = }, {y = } -> {div(x, y) = }")
      File "path/to/func.py", line 11, in div
        return x / y
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

The traceback indicates all calls (top to bottom) that cause an exception.

Exception handling
==================

It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions.
The ``try`` statement is used to do that.

The try statement works as follows.

#.  First, the try clause (the statement(s) between the try and except
    keywords) is executed.
#.  If no exception occurs, the except clause is skipped and execution of
    the try statement is finished.
#.  If an exception occurs during execution of the try clause, the rest of
    the clause is skipped. Then, if its type matches the exception named after
    the except keyword, the except clause is executed, and then execution
    continues after the try/except block.
#.  If an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in
    the except clause, it is passed on to outer try statements; if no handler
    is found, it is an unhandled exception and execution stops with a message
    as shown above.

.. code-block:: python

    from func import div

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
        y = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
        try:
            print(f"{x = }, {y = } -> {div(x, y) = }")
        except:
            print("An exception occurs")

A try statement may have more than one except clause, to specify handlers for
different exceptions.

.. code-block:: python

    from func import div

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
        y = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
        try:
            print(f"{x = }, {y = } -> {div(x, y) = }")
        except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError):
            print("An exception occurs")

.. code-block:: python

    from func import div

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
        y = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
        try:
            print(f"{x = }, {y = } -> {div(x, y) = }")
        except ValueError as exc:
            print(f"Value cannot be converted, {exc}")
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            print(f"Zero division error: {y = }")

Handling ALL exception
----------------------

It's a bad practice to handle **all** exceptions.

When indicating an ``except`` block without specifying an exception to catch it
will work for any exception, that occurs in ``try`` block. The same is relevant
for handling ``BaseException`` and ``Exception``. But you can never say what
exact goes wrong.

.. note:: However, this scenario may work for logging an exception and raising
          it again to be handled on upper levels.

          .. code-block:: python

              try:
                  ...    # some code that may raise an exception
              except:
                  ...    # logging actions
                  raise  # raise an exception again

::

    except:
        ...

    except (BaseException, Exception):
        ...

    except Exception:
        ...

All exceptions are inherited from ``Exception`` class, which is subclass of
``BaseException``. So, you can never know what exactly goes wrong with your
code.

``finally`` statement
---------------------

The ``try`` statement cannot be used itself. This will cause ``SyntaxError``.
Either ``except`` or ``finally`` block is required to be included.

While the ``except`` block tries to catch the exceptions if any,
the ``finally`` block will be always executed regardless of the exception
occurs.

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        ...  # some code that may cause an exception
    finally:
        ...  # this code will be always executed

    try:
        result = 10 // 2
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("zero division")
    finally:
        print("it's finished")

    try:
        result = 10 // 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("zero division")
    finally:
        print("it's finished")

``else`` statement
------------------

The ``try`` statement can also use ``else`` (which is optional).
The statements within this block will be execute only in case there were
no exceptions raised while running the ``try``.

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        result = 10 // 2
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("zero division")
    else:
        print("no errors occurred")  # this **WILL** be printed out

    try:
        result = 10 // 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("zero division")
    else:
        print("no errors occurred")  # this **WILL NOT** be printed out


Raising exceptions
==================

The ``raise`` statement allows the programmer to force a specified exception
to occur. The sole argument to raise indicates the exception to be raised.
This must be either an exception instance or an exception class (a class that
derives from ``BaseException``, such as ``Exception`` or one of its
subclasses). If an exception class is passed, it will be implicitly
instantiated by calling its constructor with no arguments.

.. code-block:: python

    raise NameError("name error")
    raise NameError

``raise`` statement itself will re-raise all the exceptions within the context.
Also exceptions can be raised again from the ``except`` block. It's a common
pattern to catch the exception for loggers and when re-raise it.

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        result = 10 // 0
    except:
        print("zero division")
        raise

Creating custom exceptions
==========================

Programs may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception class.
Exceptions should typically be derived from the Exception class, either
directly or indirectly.

Exception classes can be defined which do anything any other class can do,
but are usually kept simple, often only offering a number of attributes that
allow information about the error to be extracted by handlers for
the exception.

Most exceptions are defined with names that end in "Error", similar to the
naming of the standard exceptions.

Many standard modules define their own exceptions to report errors that may
occur in functions they define.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: User-defined exception

    class InvalidInputError(Exception):
        """This is a custom exception for demo needs"""


    class NegativeError(ValueError):
        """Raised when a negative value passed"""


    def sum_positive(x: int, y: int) -> int:
        """Return the sum of positive integers"""

        if x < 0 or y < 0:
            raise NegativeError

        return x + y


    try:
        x = int(input("Enter number x: "))
        y = int(input("Enter number y: "))
        result = sum_positive(x, y)
    except ValueError:
        raise InvalidInputError("could not convert to integer")
    except NegativeError:
        print("this function works only with positive integers")
