*******************************************************************************

In computer science a **variable** is a named storage location in memory that
can hold a value (*data*). The value stored in a variable can be changed or
accessed by the program during its execution.

In Python, variables are created dynamically once a value is assigned to them.
This makes Python a dynamically typed language, which means that the data type
of a variable is inferred from the value assigned to it. So, you do not need
to declare a variable before using it, as in statically typed languages.

The ability to create variables dynamically and infer their data type makes
Python code more concise and easier to read. However, it also requires careful
attention to variable naming and assignment to avoid unexpected behavior.

In Python ``=`` (assignment operator) is used to set a value to some variable,
the portion on the left of the operator is a *variable name* and the portion
on the right is a *value* to assign to a variable.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Variable assignment in Python

    number_of_students = 10
    greeting = "hello"
    pi = 3.14

.. code-block:: java
    :caption: Variable assignment in Java

    int number_of_students = 10;
    String greeting = "hello";
    double pi = 3.14;

Naming
======

In Python there are several rules that describe how to name your variables.
Some of these are requirements and cannot be ignored, others are rather
recommended than required and can be omitted. For now note, that a variable
name **cannot**:

- a language keyword (like ``pass``, ``def`` or ``class``)
- start with a number (e.g. ``123``, ``1_something``)
- contain special operators in it (``+``, ``-``, ``=`` etc.)
- contain white spaces

Also here are some general recommendation on naming anything:

- do not use built-in functions as a variable name (e.g. ``len = 42``)
- keep names meaningful (``x = 10`` vs ``number_of_student = 100``)
