*******************************************************************************

Like most VCSs, Git has the ability to tag specific points in a repository's
history as being important. Typically, people use this functionality to mark
release points (``v1.0``, ``v2.0`` and so on).

Listing tags
============

Listing the existing tags in Git is straightforward. Just type ``git tag``
(with optional ``-l`` or ``--list``).

::

    $ git tag
    v1.0
    v2.0

This command lists the tags in alphabetical order, the order in which they are
displayed has no real importance. You can also search for tags that match
a particular pattern. The Git source repo, for instance contains more than
500 tags. If you're interested only in looking at the 1.8.4 series, you can
run this:

::

    $ git tag -l "1.8.5*"
    v1.8.5
    v1.8.5-rc0
    v1.8.5-rc1
    v1.8.5-rc2
    v1.8.5-rc3

Creating tags
=============

Git supports two types of tags: *lightweight* and *annotated*.

A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn't change -- it's just
a pointer to a specific commit.

Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database.
They're checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging
message; and can be signed and verified with GBU Privacy Guard (GPG). It's
generally recommended that you create annotated tags so you can have all this
information; but if you want a temporary tag or for some reason don't want to
keep the other information, lightweight tags are available too.

.. rubric:: Annotated tags

Creating an annotated tag in Git is simple. The easiest way is to specify
``-a`` when you run the ``tag`` command:

::

    $ git tag -a VCS -m "Version Control System - tags"
    $ git tag
    VCS
    $ git show VCS
    tag VCS
    Tagger: Serhii Horodilov <sgorodil@gmail.com>
    Date:   Wed Aug 16 19:04:24 2023 +0300

.. rubric:: Lightweight tags

Another way to tag commits is with a lightweight tag. this is basically
the commit checksum stored in a file -- no other information is kept. To
create a lightweight tag, don't supply any of the ``-a``, ``-s``, or ``-m``
options, just provide a tag name:

::

    $ git tag tagging
    $ git tag
    VCS
    tagging
    $ git show tagging
    commit 21ae739f891c6ee6a77d8986402cb1e69a9b6a88 (HEAD -> feature/vcs, tag: tagging, tag: VCS)
    Author: Serhii Horodilov <sgorodil@gmail.com>
    Date:   Wed Aug 16 18:45:23 2023 +0300

        Move commits.txt content to "basics" document

.. rubric:: Tagging later

You can also tag commits after you're moved past them.

::

    $ git log --pretty=format:%h -3
    21ae739
    ea4ac00
    df216cf
    $ git tag v1.4 ea4ac00
    $ git show v1.4
    commit ea4ac002604ca897ba05c846d63af1618c123b6f (tag: v1.4)
    Author: Serhii Horodilov <sgorodil@gmail.com>
    Date:   Wed Aug 16 18:32:27 2023 +0300

Deleting tags
=============

To delete a tag on your local repository, you can use ``git tag -d <tagname>``.

::

    $ git tag -d VCS
    Deleted tag 'VCS' (was eef3831)

Checking out tags
=================

If you want to view the versions of files a tag is pointing to, you can do
a ``git checkout`` of that tag, although this puts your repository in
"detached HEAD" state, which has some ill side effects:

::

    $ git checkout VCS
    Note: switching to 'vcs'.

    You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
    changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
    state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

    If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
    do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

      git switch -c <new-branch-name>

    Or undo this operation with:

      git switch -

    Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

    HEAD is now at 60565a1 Fix GitFlow branches list

In "detached HEAD" state, if you make changes and then create a commit, the tag
will stay the same, but your new commit won’t belong to any branch and will be
unreachable, except by the exact commit hash. Thus, if you need to make changes
-- say you’re fixing a bug on an older version, for instance -- you will
generally want to create a branch:

::

    $ git checkout -b vcs-tag-branch VCS
    Switched to a new branch 'vcs-tag-branch'
