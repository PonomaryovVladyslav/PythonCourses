*******************************************************************************

To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how to manage
your remote repositories. Remote repositories are versions of your project
that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. You can have several of
them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you.
Managing remotes includes knowing how to add remote repositories, remove
remote repositories that are no longer valid, manage various branches and
define them as being tracked or not, and more.

..
    .. note::
        It is entirely possible that you can be working with a "remote"
        repository that is, in fact, on the same host you are.
        The word "remote" does not necessary imply that repository is somewhere
        else on the network or Internet, only that it is elsewhere.

Showing your remote
===================

To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the ``git remote``
command. It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you're specified. If
you've cloned your repository, you should at least see ``origin`` - that is
default name Git gives to the server you clone from:

::

    $ git remote
    origin
    upstream

    $ git remote -v
    origin  git@github.com:edu-python-course/edu-python-course.github.io (fetch)
    origin  git@github.com:edu-python-course/edu-python-course.github.io (push)
    upstream        git@github.com:PonomaryovVladyslav/PythonCources.git (fetch)
    upstream        git@github.com:PonomaryovVladyslav/PythonCources.git (push)


This means we can pull contributions from any of these users pretty easily.
We may additionally have permission to push to one or more of these.

Adding remote repositories
==========================

To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily, run
``git remote add <shortname> <url>``:

::

    $ git remote
    origin
    upstream
    $ git remote add personal https://github.com/shorodilov/python-course
    $ git remote
    origin
    upstream
    personal

Now you can use the string "personal" on the command line in lieu of the whole
URL. ``master`` branch of "https://github.com/shorodilov/python-course" is now
accessible as ``personal/master``, while shortname to the same branch in origin
will be -- ``origin/master``.

Fetching and pulling from remotes
=================================

To get data from remote project, you can run ``git fetch`` command.
The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the information
from that remote project that you don't have yet. After you do this, you should
have references to all the branches from that remote, which you can merge in or
inspect at any time.

::

    $ git fetch <remote>

If your current branch is set up to track a remote branch, you can use
``git pull`` command to automatically fetch and then merge that remote branch
into your current branch. By default, the ``git clone`` command automatically
sets up your local ``master`` branch to track the remote ``master`` branch
(or whatever default remote branch).

.. versionadded:: 2.27
    From Git version 2.27 onward, ``git pull`` will give a warning if the
    ``pull.rebase`` variable is not set. Git will keep warning you until
    you set the variable.

    If you want the default behavior of Git (fast-forward if possible, else
    create a merge commit): ``git config --global pull.rebase "false"``.

    If you want to rebase when pulling:
    ``git config --global pull.rebase "true"``.

Pushing to remotes
==================

When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push
it upstream. The command for this is simple: ``git push <remote> <branch>``.

::

    $ git push origin master

This command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write
access and if nobody has pushed in the meantime. If you and someone else clone
at the same time and they push upstream and then you push upstream, you push
will rightly be rejected. You'll have to fetch their work first and incorporate
it into yours before you'll be allowed to push.

Pushing a new branch to remote
------------------------------

In case you have created a local branch for some specific needs and you want
to share this branch, you need to set up track for this branch. This can be
done by using: ``git push --set-upstream origin <remote_branch>``. This will
create a new remote branch and set up track to your current local branch.
There is a shortcut for this command: ``git push -u origin <remote_branch>``.

Inspecting a remote
===================

If you want to see more information about a particular remote, you can use the
``git remote show <remote`` command.

::

    $ git remote show origin
    * remote origin
      Fetch URL: git@github.com:edu-python-course/edu-python-course.github.io
      Push  URL: git@github.com:edu-python-course/edu-python-course.github.io
      HEAD branch: master
      Remote branches:
        devel                                tracked
        feature/contributing                 tracked
        feature/libms                        tracked
        feature/pdf-builder                  tracked
        feature/translations                 tracked
        feature/vcs                          tracked
        gh-pages                             tracked
        master                               tracked
        refs/remotes/origin/blog-project     stale (use 'git remote prune' to remove)
        refs/remotes/origin/feature/homepage stale (use 'git remote prune' to remove)
        refs/remotes/origin/feature/patterns stale (use 'git remote prune' to remove)
      Local branches configured for 'git pull':
        devel                merges with remote devel
        feature/contributing merges with remote feature/contributing
        feature/intro-intl   merges with remote feature/intro-intl
        feature/libms        merges with remote feature/libms
        feature/pdf-builder  merges with remote feature/pdf-builder
        feature/translations merges with remote feature/translations
        feature/vcs          merges with remote feature/vcs
        master               merges with remote master
      Local refs configured for 'git push':
        devel                pushes to devel                (up to date)
        feature/contributing pushes to feature/contributing (up to date)
        feature/libms        pushes to feature/libms        (up to date)
        feature/pdf-builder  pushes to feature/pdf-builder  (up to date)
        feature/translations pushes to feature/translations (up to date)
        feature/vcs          pushes to feature/vcs          (fast-forwardable)
        master               pushes to master               (up to date)


It lists the URL for the remote repository as wll as the tracking branch
information. The command helpfully tells you that if you're on the ``master``
branch amd you run ``git pull``, it will automatically merge the remote's
``master`` branch into the local one after it has been fetched. It also lists
all the remote references it has pulled down.
