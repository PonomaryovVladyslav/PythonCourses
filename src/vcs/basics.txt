*******************************************************************************

Getting a Git repository
========================

You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:

#.  You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control,
    and turn it into a Git repository.
#.  You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.

In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine,
ready for work.

Initializing repo in an existing directory
------------------------------------------

If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and
you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that
project's directory. If you've never done this, it looks a little different
depending on which system you're running:

.. code-block:: shell
    :caption: Change directory in bash (Linux)

    cd /home/user/project

.. code-block:: shell
    :caption: Change directory in bash (MacOS)

    cd /Users/user/project

.. code-block:: powershell
    :caption: Change directory in PowerShell (Windows)

    cd C:\Users\user\project

In the project's directory initialize a new Git repository.

::

    git init

This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary
repository files -- a Git repository skeleton.

Cloning an existing repo
------------------------

If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository -- for example,
a project you'd like to contribute to -- the command you need is ``git clone``.

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/edu-python-course/edu-python-course.github.io

That creates a directory named *edu-python-course.github.io*, initializes a
*.git* directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository,
and checks out a working copy of the latest version.

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/edu-python-course/edu-python-course.github.io python-course

That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory
is called *python-course*.

Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous
example uses the ``https://`` protocol, but you may also see ``git://`` or
``user@server:path/to/repo.git``, which uses the SSH transfer protocol.

Making changes to the repo
==========================

At this point, you should have a *bona fide* Git repository on your local
machine, and a checkout or *working copy* of all of its files in front of you.
Typically, you'll want to start making changes and committing snapshots of
those changes into your repository each time the project reaches a state you
want to record.

Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states:
**tracked** or **untracked**.

-   Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot, as well as any
    newly staged files; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. In short,
    tracked files are files that Git knows about.
-   Untracked files are everything else -- any files in your working directory
    that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area.
    Untracked basically means that Git sees a file you didn't have in
    a previous snapshot (commit), and which hasn't been yet staged.

Checking out status of the file(s)
----------------------------------

The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is
the ``git status`` command.

::

    $ # check status
    $ git status
    On branch devel

    No commits yet

    nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

    $ # add file to the repository
    $ echo "# Project Title" > README.md
    $ # check status once again
    $ git status
    On branch devel

    No commits yet

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
            README.md

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Newly added *README.md* file is untracked, because it's under "Untracked files"
heading the status output.

Tracking new files
------------------

In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the ``git add`` command.

::

    $ git add README.md
    $ git status
    On branch devel

    No commits yet

    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
            new file:   README.md

From now *README.md* file is **added** to the stage area and ready to be
committed (is under "Changes to be committed" heading).

.. hint::
    You can use wildcards, to stage multiple files at once. The most common
    use cases is to add **all** modified files, or files inside of a specific
    directory.

    ::

        git add *     # stage all changes
        git add .     # stage all changes in current directory
        git add docs  # stage all changes in "docs" directory

Staging modified files
----------------------

If a staged (or already committed) file has been changed, it will be moved
under "Modified" heading. These changes wouldn't be committed unless they are
staged.

::

    $ git status
    On branch devel

    No commits yet

    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
            new file:   README.md

    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
            modified:   README.md

-   Changes may be added to the stage area by repeating ``git add`` command.
-   Changes may be discard by ``git restore <file>`` command. This action will
    restore file to its **staged** version.

Committing changes
------------------

Now that the stage area is set up the way required, it's time to commit
changes. Remember that anything that is still unstaged -- any files you
have created or modified that you haven't run git add on since you edited
them -- won't go into this commit.

The simplest way to commit is to type ``git commit``:

::

    git commit

Doing so launches your editor of choice.

.. note::
    This is set by your shell's EDITOR environment variable -- usually vim or
    emacs, although you can configure it with whatever you want using
    the ``git config --global core.editor``

Alternatively, you can type your commit message inline with the ``commit``
command by specifying it after a ``-m`` flag, like this:

::

    git commit -m "Add GitHub workflow to test Sphinx builds for PRs to devel"

Although it can be amazingly useful for crafting commits exactly how you want
them, the staging area is sometimes a bit more complex than you need in your
workflow. If you want to skip the staging area, Git provides a simple shortcut.
Adding the ``-a`` option to the ``git commit`` command makes Git automatically
stage every file that is already tracked before doing the commit, letting you
skip the git add part:

::

    $ git status
    On branch devel

    No commits yet

    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
            new file:   README.md

    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
            modified:   README.md

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
            example.json

    $ git commit -a -m "Commit tracked files"
    [devel (root-commit) 7acb7a1] Commit tracked files
     1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
     create mode 100644 README.md

    $ git status
    On branch devel
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
            example.json

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Ignoring files
--------------

Often, there is a class of files, that should not be a part of a repo. You
want these files to be prevent from being automatically added or even shown
as being untracked. These are generally files produced by loggers or a build
system, or some local settings for the project that shouldn't be shared across
other developers or maintainers. In such cases you can create a *.gitignore*
file. Here is the content of *.gitignore* used in current repository:

::

    # virtual environment
    /.venv/
    /.env/
    /venv/
    /env/

    # node packages
    /node_modules/

    # ide configs
    /.vscode/
    /.idea/

    # emacs cache and backup files
    \#*
    *~

    # temporary files storage
    /temp/
    /tmp/

    # documentation builds
    _builds/
    _build/
    builds/
    build/

    # translation object files
    *.pot
    *.mo

These lines mean:

-   Content within directories named ".venv", ".env", "venv" or "env"
    will be ignored completely.
-   Content within "node_modules" directory will be ignored completely.
-   Any files within directories named ".vscode" or ".idea" will be ignored
    completely.
-   Any file with name starting with hash (#) will be ignored.
-   Any file with name ending with tilda (~) will be ignored.
-   Content within directories named "temp" or "tmp" will be ignored
    completely.
-   Content within directories named "_builds", "_build", "builds" or
    "build" will be ignored completely.
-   Any file with name ending with ".pot" will be ignored.
-   Any file with name ending with ".mo" will be ignored.

Setting up a *.gitignore* file for your new repository before you get going is
generally a good idea so you don't accidentally commit files that you really
don't want in your Git repository.

The rules for the patterns you can put in the *.gitignore* file are as follows:

-   Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.
-   Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively throughout
    the entire working tree.
-   You can start patterns with a forward slash (/) to avoid recursive
    inclusion.
-   You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.
-   You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).

Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use.
An asterisk (\*) matches zero or more characters; [ab] matches any character
inside the brackets (in this case a or b); a question mark (?) matches
a single character; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen
([0-9]) matches any character between them (in this case 0 through 9).
You can also use two asterisks to match nested directories;
a/\*\*/z would match *a/z*, *a/b/z*, *a/b/c/z*, and so on.

Viewing the commit history
==========================

After you have created several commits, or if you have cloned a repository with
an existing commit history, you'll probably want to look back to see what has
happened. The most basic and powerful tool to do this is the ``git log``
command.

::

By default, with no arguments, ``git log`` lists the commits made in that
repository in reverse chronological order; that is, the most recent commits
show up first. As you can see, this command lists each commit with its SHA-1
checksum, the author's name and email, the date written, and the commit
message.

One of the more helpful options is ``-p`` or ``--patch``, which shows the
difference (the *patch* output) introduced in each commit. You can also
limit the number of log entries displayed, such as using ``-<number>`` to
show only desired number of latest entries.

::

This option display the same information but with a diff directly following
each entry. This is very helpful for code review or to quickly browse what
happened during a series of commits that a collaborator has added. You can also
use a series of summarizing options with ``git log``.

If you want to see some abbreviated stats for each commit, you can use the
``--stat`` option:

::

    $ git log -1 --stat

Another really useful option is ``--pretty``. This option changes the log
output to formats other that the default. A few prebuilt option values are
available for you to use. The ``oneline`` value for this option prints each
commit on a single line, which is useful if you're look a lot of commits.
In addition, the ``short``, ``full``, and ``fuller`` values show the output
in roughly the same format but with less or more information.

The ``oneline`` and ``format`` option values are particularly useful with
another ``log`` option called ``--graph``. This option adds a nice little
ASCII graph showing your branch and merge history:

::

There are many more output-formatting options to ``git log``. Common options to
``git log`` are:

+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

Limiting log output
-------------------

In addition to output-formatting options, ``git log`` takes a number of useful
limiting options; that is options that let you show only a subset of commits.
You've seen one such option already -- the ``-<number>`` (e.g. ``-2`` or
``-10``) option, which displays only the given number of latest commits.

::

    $ git log -5 --oneline
    db87ca0 (HEAD -> feature/vcs) fixup! Add commit history section (git log)
    df9d599 Add commit history section (git log)
    8b755eb (origin/feature/vcs) Update gitflow diagram
    1e131a0 fixup! Add translations to VSC documents
    895dc24 Add translations to VSC documents

However, the time-limiting options such as ``--since`` and ``--until`` are very
useful. For example, the command to get the list of commits made in the last
two weeks:

::

    $ git log --since=2.weeks

This command works with lots of formats - you can specify a specific date like
``"2022-02-24"``, or relative date such as ``"2 years 1 days 3 minutes ago"``.

The last really useful option to pass to ``git log`` as a filter is a path. If
you specify a directory or file name, you can limit the log output to commits
that introduced a change to those files. This is always the last option and
is generally preceded by double dashes (``--``) to separate the paths from
the options:

::

    $ git log --oneline -- src/vcs/basics.txt
    30cb1a2 Fix apostrophe for VCS files
    4a9cfe4 Move mermaid diagrams to a dedicated folder (git)
    80a1ab3 Add branching and merging document
    3978779 Add committing changes section
    a40712a Add git ignore section
    e92b12f Add making changes section
    c23f8ff Update getting repository section
    582569d Add Git basics document (draft)

Undoing things
==============

At any stage, you may want to undo something.

One of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly
forget to add some files, or you mess up your commit message. If you want
to redo that commit, make the additional changes you forgot, stage them,
and commit again using the ``--amend`` option:

::

    $ git commit --amend

E.g.

::

    $ git commit -m "Initial commit"
    $ git add forgotten_file
    $ git commit --amend

Unstaging a staged file
-----------------------

The next two sections demonstrate how to work with your staging area and
working directory changes. The nice part is that the command you use to
determine the state of those two areas also reminds you how to undo changes
to them.

::

    $ git add *
    $ git status
    On branch master

    Changes to be committed:
        (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
            renamed: README.md -> README
            modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
    $ git reset HEAD CONTRIBUTING.md
    Unstaged changes after reset:
    M CONTRIBUTING.md
    $ git status
    On branch master

    Changes to be committed:
        (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
            renamed: README.md -> README

    Changes not staged for commit:
        (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
        (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
            modified: CONTRIBUTING.md

Unmodifiyng a modified file
---------------------------

What if you realize that you don't want to keep your changes to some file?
You can easily unmodify it -- **revert** it back to what it looked like when
you last committed. ``git status`` also tells you how to do that:

::

    (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

It tells you pretty explicitly how to discard the changes you've make.

::

    $ git checkout -- CONTRIBUTING.md
    $ git status
    On branch master

    Changes to be committed:
        (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
            renamed: README.md -> README

Undoing things with git restore
-------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.23.0
    ``git restore`` is basically an alternative to ``git reset``, from
    Git version 2.23.0 onwards, Git will use ``git restore`` instead of
    ``git reset`` for many undo operations.

::

    $ git add *
    $ git status
    On branch master

    Changes to be committed:
        (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
            modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
            renamed: README.md -> README
    $ git restore --staged CONTRIBUTING.md
    $ git status
    On branch master

    Changes to be committed:
        (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
            renamed: README.md -> README

    Changes not staged for commit:
        (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
        (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
            modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
    $ git restore CONTRIBUTING.md
    $ git status
    On branch master

    Changes to be committed:
        (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
            renamed: README.md -> README

.. important::
    It’s important to understand that git restore <file> is a dangerous
    command. Any local changes you made to that file are gone -- Git just
    replaced that file with the last staged or committed version. Don't ever
    use this command unless you absolutely know that you don’t want those
    unsaved local changes.
