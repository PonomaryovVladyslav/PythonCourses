Querying data
*************

The process of retrieving or the command to retrieve data from a database is
called a *query*. In SQL the ``SELECT`` command is used to specify queries.

``SELECT`` retrieves rows from zero or more tables. The general processing of
``SELECT`` is as follows:

#.  All queries in the ``WITH`` list are computed.
    This effectively serve as temporary tables that can be referenced in the
    ``FROM`` list.
#.  All elements in the ``FROM`` list are computed. If more than one element
    is specified in the ``FROM`` list, they are cross-joined together.
#.  If ``WHERE`` clause is specified, all rows that do not satisfy
    the condition are eliminated from the output.
#.  If the ``GROUP BY`` clause is specified, or if there are aggregate function
    calls, the output is combined into groups of rows that match on one or more
    values, and the result of aggregate functions are computed.
    If the ``HAVING`` clause is present, it eliminates groups that does not
    satisfy the given condition.
#.  The actual output rows are computed using the ``SELECT`` output expressions
    for each row or row of group.
#.  ``SELECT DISTINCT`` eliminates duplicate rows from the result.
    ``SELECT DISTINCT ON`` eliminates rows that match on all the specified
    expressions.
#.  Using the operators ``UNION``, ``INTERSECT``, and ``EXCEPT``, the output
    of more than one ``SELECT`` statement can be combined to form a single
    result set.

    -   The ``UNION`` operator returns **all** rows that are in one or both
        result sets.
    -   The ``INTERSECT`` operator returns all rows that are strictly in both
        result sets.
    -   The ``EXCEPT`` operator returns the rows that are in the first result
        set, but not in the second.

#.  If the ``ORDER BY`` clause is specified, the returned rows are sorted in
    the specific order.
#.  if the ``LIMIT`` or ``OFFSET`` clause is specified, the ``SELECT``
    statement only returns a subset of the result rows.
#.  If ``FOR UPDATE``, ``FOR NO KEY UPDATE``, ``FOR SHARE`` or
    ``FOR KEY SHARE`` is specified, the ``SELECT`` statement locks the selected
    rows against concurrent updates.

Select rows from a table
========================

A simple kind of query has the form:

.. code-block:: postgresql

    SELECT * FROM publisher;

This command would retrieve all rows and all user-defined columns from
``publisher`` table. A select list can also select a subset of the available
columns or make calculations using the columns.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    SELECT title, page_count / 2
    FROM book;

``FROM`` clause is a simple kind of table expression: it reads just one table.
In general, table expression can be complex constructs of base tables, joins
and sub-queries. But it is possible to omit the table expression entirely and
use the ``SELECT`` command as a calculator (or in some another way):

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT 40 + 2;

The ``FROM`` clause derives a table from one or more other tables given in
a comma-separated table reference list. A table reference can a table name,
or derived table such as sub-query, a ``JOIN`` construct, or complex
combinations of these. If more than one table reference is listed in the
``FROM`` clause, the table are cross-joined. The result of the ``FROM`` list
is an intermediate virtual table tant can then be subject to transformations
by the ``WHERE``, ``GROUP BY``, and ``HAVING`` clauses and is finally the
result of the overall table expression.

Search conditions
=================

After the processing of the ``FROM`` clause is done, each row of the derived
virtual table can be checked against the search condition. If the result of
the condition is ``true``, the row is kept in the output table, otherwise it
is discarded. The ``WHERE`` clause is used to handle search condition checks.

Here are some examples of ``WHERE`` clause:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT ... FROM fdt
    WHERE c1 > 5;

    SELECT ... FROM fdt
    WHERE c1 IN (1, 2, 3);

    SELECT ... FROM fdt
    WHERE c1 IN (SELECT c1 FROM t2);

    SELECT ... FROM fdt
    WHERE c1 IN (SELECT c3 FROM t2 WHERE c2 = fdt.c1 + 10);

    SELECT ... FROM fdt
    WHERE c1 BETWEEN (SELECT c3 FROM t2 WHERE c2 = fdt.c1 + 10) AND 100;

    SELECT ... FROM fdt
    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT c1 FROM t2 WHERE c2 > fdt.c1);

Grouping data
=============

After passing the ``WHERE`` filter, the derived input table might be subject
to grouping, using ``GROUP BY`` clause, and elimination of group rows using
the ``HAVING`` clause. The ``GROUP BY`` clause is used to group together those
rows in a table that have the same values in all the columns listed. The order
in the columns are listed does not matter. The effect is to combine each set of
rows having common values into one group row that represents all rows in the
group. This is done to eliminate redundancy in the output and/or compute
aggregates that apply to these groups.

Select lists
============

As shown is the previous section, the table expression in the ``SELECT``
command constructs an intermediate virtual table by possibly combining tables,
views, eliminating rows, grouping etc. This table is finally passed on to
processing by the *select list*. The select list determines which *columns*
of the intermediate table are actually output.

Select list items
-----------------

The simplest kind of select is ``*`` which emits that the table expression
produces. Otherwise, a select list is a comma-separated list of value
expressions. For instance:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT first_name, last_name
    FROM author;

Columns labels
--------------

The entries listed in the select list can be assigned names for subsequent
processing.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT title, page_count / 2 as sheets FROM book;

If no output column name  is specified using ``AS``, the system will assign
a default column name. For simple column references, this is the name of
the referenced column. For function calls, this is the name of the function.
For complex expressions, the system will generate a generic name.

.. note::

    Labels are often referenced as "aliases".

DISTINCT
--------

After the select list has been processed, the result table can optionally be
subject to the elimination of duplicate rows. The ``DISTINCT`` key word is
written directly after ``SELECT`` to specify this:

.. note::

    SELECT DISTINCT publisher FROM book;

Obviously, two rows are considered distinct if they differ in at least one
column value. Null values are considered equal in comparison. Alternatively,
an arbitrary expression can determine what rows are to be considered distinct.

.. code-block::

    SELECT DISTINCT ON (expression [, expression ...]) select_list ...

Combining queries
=================

The results of two queries can be combined using the set operations union,
intersection, and difference.

.. code-block::

    query1 UNION [ALL] query2
    query1 INTERSECT [ALL] query2
    query1 EXCEPT [ALL] query2

``UNION`` effectively appends the result of ``query2`` to the result of
``query1`` (although there is no guarantee that this is the order in which
the rows are actually returned). Furthermore, it eliminates duplicate rows from
its result, in the same way as ``DISTINCT``, unless ``UNION ALL`` is used.

``INTERSECT`` returns all rows that are both in the result of ``query1`` and in
the result of ``query2``. Duplicate rows are eliminated unless
``INTERSECT ALL`` is used.

``EXCEPT`` returns all rows that are in the result of ``query1`` but not in
the result of ``query2``. (This is sometimes called the difference between two
queries.) Again, duplicates are eliminated unless ``EXCEPT ALL`` is used.

Sorting rows
============

After a query has produced an output table it can optionally be sorted.
If sorting is not chosen, the rows will be returned in an unspecified order.
The actual order in this case will depend on the scan and join plan types and
the order on disk, but it must not be relied on.

The ``ORDER BY`` clause specifies the sort order:

.. code-block:: postgresql

    SELECT title, publisher_id FROM book ORDER BY title;

The sort expression(s) can be any expression that would be valid in the query's
select list.

When more than one expression is specified, the later values are used to sort
rows that are equal according to the earlier values. Each expression can be
followed by an option ``ASC`` or ``DESC`` keyword to set the sort direction
to ascending or descending. ``ASC`` order is the default.

The ``NULL FIRST`` and ``NULL LAST`` options can be used to determine whether
null appear before or after non-null values in the sort ordering. By default,
null values sort as if larger than any non-null value; that's, ``NULL FIRST``
is the default for ``DESC`` order, and ``NULL LAST`` otherwise.

Note that the ordering options are considered independently for each sort
column. For example ``ORDER BY x, y DESC`` means ``ORDER BY x ASC, y DESC``,
which is not the same as ``ORDER BY x DESC, y DESC``.

A sort expression can also be the column label or number of an output column.

``ORDER BY`` can be applied to the result of a ``UNION``, ``INTERSECT``, or
``EXCEPT`` combination, but in this case it is only permitted to sort by
output column names or numbers, not by expressions.

Limit and Offset
================

``LIMIT`` and ``OFFSET`` allow you to retrieve just a portion of the rows that
are generated by the rest of the query.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    SELECT * FROM publisher LIMIT 10;

The query above fetches only first 10 rows from the "publisher" table.

If a limit count is given, no more than that many rows will be returned.
But possibly fewer, if the query itself yields fewer rows.
``LIMIT ALL`` is the same as omitting the ``LIMIT`` clause, as is ``LIMIT``
with ``NULL`` argument.

``OFFSET`` says to skip that many rows before beginning to return rows.
``OFFSET 0`` is the same as omitting the ``OFFSET`` clause, as is ``OFFSET``
with a ``NULL`` argument.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    SELECT * FROM publisher LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
    
The query above fetches 10 publishers starting from the 11-th one.

When using ``LIMIT`` and/or ``OFFSET``, it's important to use ``ORDER BY``
clause that constraints the result rows into a unique order. Otherwise you
will get an unpredictable subset of the query's rows.

WITH queries
============

``WITH`` provides a way to write auxiliary statements for use in a larger
query. These statements, which are often referred to as
:abbr:`CTE (Common Table Expression)`, can be thought of as defining temporary
tables that exist just for one query. Each auxiliary statement in a ``WITH``
clause can be a ``SELECT``, ``INSERT``, ``UPDATE`` or ``DELETE``; and the
``WITH`` clause itself is attached to a primary statement that can be a
``SELECT``, ``INSERT``, ``UPDATE``, ``DELETE`` or ``MERGE``.

Select in WITH
--------------

The basic value of ``SELECT`` in ``WITH`` is to break down complicated queries
into simpler parts.

.. code-block:: postgresql
    :caption: Get most profitable months

    -- select top revenue months
    WITH monthly_revenue AS (SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date)  AS year,
                                    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month,
                                    SUM(amount)              AS total_amount
                             FROM revenue
                             GROUP BY year, month
                             ORDER BY year, month)
    SELECT *
    FROM monthly_revenue
    WHERE total_amount > (SELECT SUM(total_amount) / 100 FROM monthly_revenue)
    ORDER BY total_amount DESC;

Recursive queries
-----------------

The optional ``RECURSIVE`` modifier changes WITH from a mere syntactic
convenience into a feature that accomplishes things not otherwise possible in
standard SQL. Using ``RECURSIVE``, a ``WITH`` query can refer to its own
output.

.. code-block:: postgresql
    :caption: Sum of first 10 numbers starting from 1

    WITH RECURSIVE t(n) AS (VALUES (1) UNION SELECT n + 1 FROM t WHERE n < 10)
    SELECT sum(n)
    FROM t;

.. important::

    When working with recursive queries it is important to be sure that
    the recursive part of the query will eventually return no tuple, or else
    the query will loop indefinitely.

Data modifying statements in WITH
---------------------------------

You can use most data-modifying statements (``INSERT``, ``UPDATE``, ``DELETE``)
in ``WITH``. This allows you to perform several different operations at a time,
in the same query.

.. code-block:: postgresql
    :caption: Remove old revenue records and store them into history table

    WITH deleted_rows AS (
        DELETE FROM revenue
            WHERE date < '2020-01-01'
            RETURNING *)
    INSERT
    INTO revenue_log
    SELECT *
    FROM deleted_rows;

Join data from different tables
===============================

A ``JOIN`` clause combines two ``FROM`` items, which for convenience we will
refer as "tables", though in reality they can be any type of ``FROM`` items.
Available join types are:

-   ``[INNER] JOIN``
-   ``LEFT [OUTER] JOIN``
-   ``RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN``
-   ``FULL [OUTER] JOIN``

.. note::

    Key words in bracket parentheses above are optional.

Joins between tables
--------------------

.. literalinclude:: /../libms-db/libms.sql
    :caption: Publishers and books tables definitions
    :language: postgresql
    :lines: 14-23,50-62

Following tables are related via ``FOREIGN KEY`` constraint. Each record in
the ``book`` table references some record in the ``publisher`` table.

.. important::

    Since original tables contain lots of data, temporary tables will be
    created instead before join query. Full tables content may be downloaded
    via links:
    :download:`publisher </../libms-db/assets/csv/publisher.csv>`,
    :download:`book </../libms-db/assets/csv/book.csv>`.

    The subsets from original queries defined as:

    .. code-block:: postgresql

        SELECT *
        FROM (VALUES (1, 'Zoonoodle'),
                     (3, 'Tanoodle'),
                     (4, 'Skivee'))
                 AS publisher(id, name);

    +----+-----------+
    | id |name       |
    +====+===========+
    |  1 | Zoonoodle |
    +----+-----------+
    |  3 | Tanoodle  |
    +----+-----------+

    .. code-block:: postgresql

        SELECT *
        FROM (VALUES (22, 'pretium nisl', 2),
                     (38, 'ac est lacinia nisi venenatis', 3),
                     (69, 'vel accumsan tellus nisi', 3),
                     (72, 'nam dui proin', 2),
                     (85, 'nam tristique', 2))
                 AS book(id, title, publisher_id);

    +----+-------------------------------+--------------+
    | id | title                         | publisher_id |
    +====+===============================+==============+
    | 22 | pretium nisl                  | 2            |
    +----+-------------------------------+--------------+
    | 38 | ac est lacinia nisi venenatis | 3            |

    | 85 | nam tristique                 | 2            |
    +----+-------------------------------+--------------+

By passing multiple tables to the ``FROM`` clause a ``CROSS JOIN`` query is
executed. This means the resulting table is the Cartesian product of two
original tables.

.. code-block:: postgresql
    :caption: Cross join (Cartesian product)

    WITH publisher AS
             (SELECT *
              FROM (VALUES (1, 'Zoonoodle'),
                           (3, 'Tanoodle'),
                           (4, 'Skivee'))
                  AS publisher(id, name)),
         book AS
             (SELECT *
              FROM (VALUES (22, 'pretium nisl', 2),
                           (38, 'ac est lacinia nisi venenatis', 3),
                           (69, 'vel accumsan tellus nisi', 3),
                           (72, 'nam dui proin', 2),
                           (85, 'nam tristique', 2))
                       AS book(id, title, publisher_id))
    -- querying the joined result
    SELECT *
    FROM book,
         publisher;

By defining the ``WHERE`` clause rows that do not match the condition may
be eliminated from the result.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    SELECT *
    FROM book, publisher
    WHERE book.publisher_id = publisher.id;

+----+-------------------------------+--------------+----+----------+
| id | title                         | publisher_id | id | name     |
+====+===============================+==============+====+==========+
| 38 | ac est lacinia nisi venenatis | 3            | 3  | Tanoodle |
+----+-------------------------------+--------------+----+----------+
| 69 | vel accumsan tellus nisi      | 3            | 3  | Tanoodle |
+----+-------------------------------+--------------+----+----------+

This is called ``INNER JOIN``, which means that the result table will contain
only whose rows from left-hard and right-hand tables, that have corresponding
records to each other.

The same result may be obtained using ``JOIN`` clause. All ``JOIN`` options are
just a notation convenience, since they do nothing you couldn't do with plain
``FROM`` and ``WHERE``.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    SELECT *
    FROM book b
             JOIN publisher p ON b.publisher_id = p.id;

``INNER JOIN`` is the default while joining two tables with each other.

Right and left joins
--------------------

``LEFT OUTER JOIN`` returns all rows in the qualified Cartesian product
(i.e., all combined rows that pass its condition), plus one copy of each
row in the left-hand table for which there was no right-hand row that passed
the join condition.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    SELECT *
    FROM book b
             LEFT JOIN publisher p ON b.publisher_id = p.id;

+----+-------------------------------+--------------+------+----------+
| id | title                         | publisher_id | id   | name     |
+====+===============================+==============+======+==========+
| 22 | pretium nisl                  | 2            | null | null     |
+----+-------------------------------+--------------+------+----------+
| 38 | ac est lacinia nisi venenatis | 3            | 3    | Tanoodle |
+----+-------------------------------+--------------+------+----------+
| 69 | vel accumsan tellus nisi      | 3            | 3    | Tanoodle |
+----+-------------------------------+--------------+------+----------+
| 72 | nam dui proin                 | 2            | null | null     |
+----+-------------------------------+--------------+------+----------+
| 85 | nam tristique                 | 2            | null | null     |
+----+-------------------------------+--------------+------+----------+

Conversely, ``RIGHT OUTER JOIN`` returns all the joined rows, plus one row for
each unmatched right-hand row. This is just a notation convenience, since you
could convert it to a ``LEFT OUTER JOIN`` by switching the left and right
tables.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    SELECT *
    FROM book b
             RIGHT JOIN publisher p ON b.publisher_id = p.id;

+------+-------------------------------+--------------+----+-----------+
| id   | title                         | publisher_id | id | name      |
+======+===============================+==============+====+===========+
| 38   | ac est lacinia nisi venenatis | 3            | 3  | Tanoodle  |
+------+-------------------------------+--------------+----+-----------+
| 69   | vel accumsan tellus nisi      | 3            | 3  | Tanoodle  |
+------+-------------------------------+--------------+----+-----------+
| null | null                          | null         | 4  | Skivee    |
+------+-------------------------------+--------------+----+-----------+
| null | null                          | null         | 1  | Zoonoodle |
+------+-------------------------------+--------------+----+-----------+

Full outer join
---------------

.. code-block:: postgresql

    SELECT *
    FROM book b
             FULL JOIN publisher p ON b.publisher_id = p.id;

+------+-------------------------------+--------------+------+-----------+
| id   | title                         | publisher_id | id   | name      |
+======+===============================+==============+======+===========+
| 22   | pretium nisl                  | 2            | null | null      |

| 38   | ac est lacinia nisi venenatis | 3            | 3    | Tanoodle  |
