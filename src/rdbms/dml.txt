Data Manipulation Language
**************************

:abbr:`DML (Data Manipulation Language)` is a subset of SQL used for adding,
updating, and deleting data within database tables.

-   ``SELECT`` used to query data from the database
-   ``INSERT`` used to insert new data into a table
-   ``UPDATE`` used to modify existing data
-   ``DELETE`` used to remove data from a table

Creating new records
====================

When a table is created, it contains no data. Inserting data will populate
a table with values. Data is inserted one row at a time. You can also insert
multiple rows with a single command. But it impossible to insert something
that is not a complete row.

To create a new row use ``INSERT`` command.

The data values are listed in the order in which the columns appear in
the table, separated by commas. This syntax has the drawback that you need to
know the order of the columns in the table. To avoid this you can also list
the columns explicitly. If you don't have values for all the columns, you can
omit some of them. In that case, the columns will be filled with their default
values.

.. literalinclude:: /../libms-db/libms.sql
    :caption: Create publisher table
    :language: postgresql
    :start-after: -- label: ddl-publisher
    :end-before: -- label:

.. literalinclude:: /../libms-db/libms.sql
    :caption: Insert data to publisher table
    :language: postgresql
    :start-after: -- label: dml-publisher
    :end-before: -- label:

You can insert multiple rows in a single command.

.. literalinclude:: /../libms-db/libms.sql
    :caption: Create author table
    :language: postgresql
    :start-after: -- label: ddl-author
    :end-before: -- label:

.. literalinclude:: /../libms-db/libms.sql
    :caption: Inserting multiple values at a time
    :language: postgresql
    :lines: 251-260,400-402

.. note::

    There is a reference to the "publisher" table present below. Think of it
    like placing the publisher information directly into "book" table for now.

.. literalinclude:: /../libms-db/libms.sql
    :caption: Create book table
    :language: postgresql
    :start-after: -- label: ddl-book
    :end-before: -- label:

.. literalinclude:: /../libms-db/libms.sql
    :caption: Inserting records from file
    :language: postgresql
    :start-after: -- label: dml-book
    :end-before: -- label:

Modifying records
=================

The modification of data that is already in the database is referred as
updating. To update the existing rows, use the ``UPDATE`` command.
This requires three pieces of information:

#.  The name of the table and column(s) to update
#.  The new value of the column(s)
#.  Which row(s) to update

.. code-block:: postgresql

    UPDATE book SET language = 'uk' WHERE publisher = 3;

This might cause zero, one, or many rows to be updated. The update syntax
is pretty straightforward. First the key word ``UPDATE`` followed by the table
name. Next is the key word ``SET`` followed by the column name, an equal sign,
and the new column value. The new column value can be any scalar expression,
not just a constant. More than one column can be updated at a time by listing
more than one assignment in the ``SET`` clause.

.. important::

    ``WHERE`` clause is optional, but it limits the rows affected by
    ``UPDATE`` command. If there is no limitations all the records
    within a table will be updated with new values.

    .. code-block:: postgresql

        UPDATE book SET language = 'uk';

Removing data
=============

So far we have explained how to add data to tables and how to change data.
What remains to discuss how to remove data that is no longer needed. Just
as adding data is only possible in whole rows, you can only remove entire
rows from a table.

You use ``DELETE`` command to remove rows; the syntax is very similar to
the ``UPDATE`` command.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    DELETE FROM book WHERE publisher = 3;

If you simply write:

.. code-block:: postgresql

    DELETE FROM book;

then all rows in the table will be deleted!

Querying data
=============

Returning data from modified rows
---------------------------------

Sometimes it is useful to obtain data from modified rows while they are being
manipulated. The ``INSERT``, ``UPDATE`` and ``DELETE`` commands all have an
optional ``RETURNING`` clause that supports this. Use of ``RETURNING`` avoids
performing an extra database query to collect the data, and is especially
valuable when it would otherwise be difficult to identify the modified rows
reliably.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    INSERT INTO author (first_name, last_name, country, birthdate)
    VALUES ('Wendye', 'Rowbotham', 'Poland', '1932-12-16'),
           ('Grannie', 'Kidner', 'United States', '1940-02-21'),
           ('Godart', 'Van Driel', 'United Kingdom', '1980-01-02'),
           ('Meara', 'Meenehan', 'United States', '1994-12-13')
    RETURNING id;

For example the query above provides the identifiers to new rows.
